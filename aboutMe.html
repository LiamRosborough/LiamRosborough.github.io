				<h4 style="padding: 30px">
					I am a student at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Geomatics, minoring in Computing, and achieving
					the French Language II diploma! I have a passion for geography, the environment, and international development.
					I am originally from a small town called Lakefield, Ontario, which is located just North of Peterborough, Ontario.

				<h4 style="padding: 30px">
					I have taken courses in a lot of different subject areas, including physical and human geography, geographic information
					systems and analysis, remote sensing, land surveying and geodesy, french language and history, and computer science! My 
					favourite courses have been my capstone remote sensing and GIS projects, as they allowed me the freedom to explore my own
					research projects in areas I'm personally interested in!

				<h4 style="padding: 30px">
					I am all set to graduate this term, and hope to get a job working with geospatial technologies in the field of
					climate change research. I plan on working for a few years to make some money, then apply to grad school for
					programs in either urban planning with a focus on green transit, or geography with a focus on remote sensing of
					the environment!

					I am a huge sports fan who loves to watch and play hockey, rugby, american and european football, volleyball, and golf!
					The teams I cheer for include the Ottawa Senators in hockey, Munster RFC in rugby, the Buffalo Bills in american football,
					and Liverpool FC in european football! I mostly play volleyball and golf now that I am in University, as they seem to require
					the least commitment!

					Outside of sports, I love travelling internationally and within Canada. I have spent time travelling with my high school rugby
					team to Ireland, as well as with family and friends to the United Kingdom and Mexico. I hope to be able to go on many more
					international trips when I graduate and COVID dies down. Within Canada, I love to go on camping trips across Ontario and Quebec.
					I am planning to go on a camping roadtrip across Canada as a celebration of finishing my undergradute degree!

					My other hobbies include playing/listening to music, and learning/practicing languages! I love all kinds of music, and play the
					drums and guitar. I decided to purchase an electric drum kit at the beginning of COVID, and it has seen a lot of action since!
					I have been a long time student of the french language, and picked up spanish during high school. I have recently started learning
					German, and can't wait to travel to Germany to immerse myself in it!
